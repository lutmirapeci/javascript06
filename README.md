### Overview: Study Timer

```
Create a personalized study timer with a visual progress bar, where users can set up personalized study sessions with breaks.
The application should visually display the progress of each session (study time + break) using a progress bar.
```

# Exercise 01

```
Create a function to get from the user input the study and break duration in minutes.
Save the study duration and break duration on local storage.
Persist the study and break duration in the local storage upon refresh.
```

# Exercise 02

```
Use JavaScript timers (setTimeout and setInterval) to count down the session and break durations.
Show the progress via a dynamic progress bar that fills up as the time for the study session + break elapses.
```

# Exercise 03

```
Notify the user via a simple alert when itâ€™s time to take a break and when to resume studying.
```

# Exercise 04(BONUS)

```
Display a log of completed study sessions and breaks including their durations.
Hint: Use LocalStorage.
